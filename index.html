								<p id='abouttext'>
									I am currently studying Web and UX Design at Yoobee School of design in Wellington. I have always been fascinated with technology and how it is forever developing. I have worked in hospitality most of my life and understand what a competitive business it can be and that a good website can be make or break for some establishments. However I also know that small family businesses don’t want to spend the huge amounts of money generally associated with a good website and so I want to be able to provide those businesses with a good website without the putting a giant hole in your pocket. If this sounds like something that you would like then take a look at some of my work and get in contact with me.

								    <h3>Scenario</h3>
								    <p>This was a group project using an external API as a data source. We were each tasked with deciding in how we wanted to display our data. Our group chose to use the google maps and google places APIs to create a site about accommodation, recreation and food in the wellington region. </p>

								    <p>I was responsible for the accommodation page. The user is able to decide what type of accommodation they would like to stay in and when they submit that information the map displays various places around the city. If a user clicks on one of the pins they are provided with more information about that specific location. </p>
